# Excel_project_1
This project involves analyzing the passenger data from the Titanic disaster using Microsoft Excel. The dataset contains various attributes of passengers such as age, sex, class, and whether they survived the tragedy. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the survival rates and to explore patterns and correlations within the data.
Objectives
Data Cleaning: Ensure the dataset is free from errors and inconsistencies.

Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, and mode for numerical attributes.

Visualizations: Create charts and graphs to visually represent the data.

Survival Analysis: Analyze the factors that influenced survival rates.

Conclusions: Summarize findings and provide insights based on the analysis.

Steps and Methods
Import Data: Load the dataset into Excel and familiarize with the structure.

Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values by either removing or imputing them.

Ensure consistency in categorical data (e.g., 'Male' vs 'male').

Descriptive Statistics:

Calculate the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for attributes like age and fare.

Use pivot tables to summarize data.

Visualizations:

Create bar charts to show the distribution of passengers by class and sex.

Use pie charts to represent survival rates across different classes.

Generate scatter plots to analyze the correlation between age and fare.

Survival Analysis:

Use COUNTIF and similar functions to calculate survival rates across different groups.

Analyze the impact of class, age, and sex on survival chances.

Conclusions:

Summarize key findings such as the higher survival rate among first-class passengers and women.

Discuss any interesting patterns or anomalies observed during the analysis.

Tools Used
Microsoft Excel

Formulas: COUNTIF, AVERAGE, MEDIAN, MODE, etc.
